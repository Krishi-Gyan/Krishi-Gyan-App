# KRISHI GYAN

We've created a Flutter app tailored for farmers, allowing them to input essential farm information like crop varieties and soil specifics. The app then leverages this data to provide personalized recommendations for fertilizers, pesticides, and suitable crop choices for their specific farm conditions.

To enhance farming precision, our app seamlessly integrates with Arduino devices and sensors, continuously monitoring factors such as soil moisture and nitrogen levels. Based on these real-time measurements, it offers actionable insights to optimize crop growth.

Furthermore, our app assists farmers in managing their daily tasks by providing a curated list of essential activities.

In addition to these features, our app fosters community and commerce among farmers. It enables users to connect with fellow farmers, facilitating the direct buying and selling of crops and seeds, thereby eliminating the need for intermediaries.
